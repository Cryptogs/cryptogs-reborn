## you also need to pull in repos like zep
##
## I also had to:
## sudo npm install -g scrypt
## install "scrypt" manually ("sudo npm install -g scrypt")
## go to "ethereum-testrpc module folder"/node_modules/scrypt
## mv build buildold
## make a symbolic link to scrypt build folder e.g. "ln -s /usr/local/lib/node_modules/scrypt/build"
## then I got in there
## and did cp scrypt.node scrypt

## I went to /Users/austingriffith/cryptogs/gatsby-site/node_modules/scrypt
## mv build buildold
## ln -s /usr/local/lib/node_modules/scrypt/build
##
## had to move my ~/.node-gyp folder and regen
